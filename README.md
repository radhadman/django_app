### PROGRESS:  

### (From the assignment requirement doc **Bold are bonus**)  

(START HADDON)  

1.(12)Adapt the django application you have been working on so far and change it so that it serves acompletely new purpose. For instance maybe it is an uber-stlye application, or a meeting roombooking system. Full marks will be awarded for creativity, originality, and depth.  
		IN PROGRESS  

2.(4)Ensure that the application can be deployed automatically one one step using only the heattemplate and environment file. Use the following repository for ideas to get you started:https://cisgitlab.ufv.ca/201901COMP351AB1s00/heat-templates.  
		IN PROGRESS

**4.(4)Your project should ideally use two virtual machines. One is a build and test server runningJenkins and another is a production server.**  
		IN PROGRESS  

**5.(4)Configure a webhook on the master branch of your webdesignproject repository so that when-ever a commit is made to the master branch, Jenkins fetches the latest code from the repositoryand deploys it to the production server.**  
		IN PROGRESS  

**6.(4)Enhance your continuous integration and testing pipeline so that the Jenkins server runs unittests on your project.**  
		IN PROGRESS  

(END ANDREW)  		

7.(4)Make your deployed application accessible using one of the following: ngrok, pagekite, argo(or similar technology)  
		IN PROGRESS  

(START ALL)  

8.(12)Your progress along the way is just as important as the final product. Ensure that you areregularly commmitting your changes to the repository. If you have difficulties coordinatingyour changes, I recommend using different branches in the same repository. Avoid creatingmultiple new repositories. Keep the README.md file in the master branch constantly updatedabout who has done work on what aspects of the application.  
		IN PROGRESS  

9.(8)Document your work. This is above and beyond the normal requirement to cite your sources.Use Markdown format (not html, not MS Word, not PDF, etc)  
		IN PROGRESS
